                I am passionate about computer programming,
                I learn very quickly and I love talking about tech.
                In fact, I love sharing what I know with others and ask if there is anything that I don't know.
                I primarily code in Java and some of my favorite software development topics
                are Design Patterns, Software Development Principles and multi-threading
